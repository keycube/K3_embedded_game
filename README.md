# How to play
In this game, you find yourself inside of the Keycube.

All tiles can be toggled on or off by pressing the corresponding key. Regularly, the game will toggle random tiles like so:

![example1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e79be906-3a7a-4e5a-9a5d-c3e975fdae1b)

Your goal is to keep the cube's opposite sides identical. However, as shown by the cross on the tiles, you can't directly toggle back the tiles that the game toggled. Instead, you must find the opposite tiles and toggle them!

Once you match the tiles, the crosses will disappear shortly after.

Be on the lookout! Even though the game will more often toggle on tiles, it can and will toggle off others! You will then need to toggle off the opposite tile.

If you leave a pair of tiles in an incorrect pattern for too long, you will receive a visual warning. If you see it, it's your cue to correct everything left, and fast!

If you fail to do so, you will lose a life. Be careful, you've only got four of them!

The game will continue until you lose all four lives. Your goal is to survive and get the highest score possible! You gain score every time you correct a tile pair that wasn't matching anymore, and the value gained will be higher the faster you do it.

And that's about it! Have fun :)
